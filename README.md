# mediaManipulator (WIP)
### A personal project for learning how to
- use argparse
- leverage Linux programs
- manipulate media files
- gather file information

It parses a given path for media files, pulls metadata from the files and populates various dictionaries with that information, and can convert/manipulate those media files based on commands given by the user.  All functionality will be accessible via argparse interactivity.
